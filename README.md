# Event-RSVP-Portal

This project is my first using C#/.NET framework. As of now, it is a simple console/terminal application. I wanted to get the backend 
components laid out before creating a GUI. This will be coming in the future.

The goal of this project is to build a login portal system for event invitees, in this case, particularly for a wedding. 

There are plenty of wedding websites out there, that allow guests to respond online. However, most of these that I have come across, will
just ask for your name, and whether you are attending or not. This will basically just pass the information along to the website
administrator... What if you weren't invited? What if you don't want uninvited guests to view certain information about your event? This
obviously isn't a common issue with most people and their weddings, but it would be nice to have an added sense of security, that only
the guests that you are inviting, can log on to view event information, or even change information. 

For this reason, I came up with this simple idea.. You send out traditional invitaitons in the mail (or however else you would like), and
on these invitations, there is listed a wedding website login number, and invitation number. When accessing the wedding website, you
would use these credentials on your invitation to RSVP to the invitation, and have access to certain material, which otherwise wouldn't
be shown.

The administrator also has the ability to log on, and view all of the guest data (Who has responded, who hasn't, who is coming, who is
bringing guests, who is eating what, etc). This information automation will save loads of time before your wedding. Instead of going
through each hand written inviation and making a list, this program will compile the data automatically for you. You will likely still
get some guests preferring to mail RSVPs back to you, so this could also be added by the administrator, once the RSVP arrives back in the
mail.
